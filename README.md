# Fake-News-Detection

Fake News detection project created with the help of Tarun papraju (https://github.com/SriRangaTarun/Fake-News-Detection) for the Stanford Inspirit AI scholars camp. This project uses Natural Language Processsing to detect whether a news article is fake based on its HTML source code.
